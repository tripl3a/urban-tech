Customer doesn't wrangle / analyze data. He focuses more on the high level stuff and leads strategically.


Presentation:
Final results (if there is one) and how we got there.
Besides explorative analysis it's recommended to also use predictive models, but it's not mandatory.

Until end of october

Business Requirements:

1.) Predict demand per hour (# of users (casual,registered,total))
2.) Intereference of variables (predictors vs. outcome) -> interpretation
	2a) parameteric: multiple regression 
	   (discuss with Biessmann wether the coefficients are interpretable or not, as he mentioned this is a misconception)
	2b) non-parameteric: tree based methods or KNN

notes:
- misconception occurs, if there's correlation between the (predictor) variables
- another way to obtain interpretability: multiply coefficients (=weights) * covariance-matrix
... Bie√ümann will gibe a lecture to explain this
